### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: How to Make a Basic AMP Page
#### Instructor: Kezz Bracey

In our article “AMP Project: Will it Make Your Sites Faster?”, we get into detail on what AMP will mean to you from a developer point of view, and give you some raw numbers on what kind of speed gains AMP may or may not give you. 

In this tutorial we'll be more practical, with a step by step guide for actually creating an AMP page from scratch, explaining how to do some common tasks the AMP way, and sharing some tips as we go.
